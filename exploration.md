## Exploration 003: Current ethics examples

### 1. Study

This brief section is meant to show how diverse and pervasive ethical issues are. In fact, there are - or should be! - ethical considerations just about everything around us.

### 2. Apply

1. Ethical considerations often arise alongside _inequal circumstances for different participants_ and _conflict among different goals or between goals and means of achieving them_. Read or skim the article [Emerging Code of Ethics for Disaster Relief](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-03534-z) and identify the _inequalities_ and _conflicts_ that arise in this domain, and how they complicate ethical behavior.
2. The coronavirus and COVID-19 pandemic has opened up a whole tsunami of ethical issues. Pick three (3) ethical issues specifically created by the pandemic and discuss them briefly.

### 3. Present

In the [Study & Discussion](README.md):

1. Discuss the article in 3.2.1.
2. Discuss the issues you picked in 3.2.2.
